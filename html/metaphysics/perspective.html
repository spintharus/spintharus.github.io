          The first thing to realize is that all things are subjective. Light enters through the eye, past a variety of focusing aparatus, onto the retina. On the retina are rod cells and cone cells, which convert light into electrical impulses, which is passed to the optic nerve. Vibrations enter through the ear, past a variety of amplifying apparatus, into the cochlea. In the cochlea are hair cells, which convert vibrations into electrical impluses, which are the passed to the auditory nerve.
